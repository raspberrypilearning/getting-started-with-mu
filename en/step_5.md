## Creating code with Mu

The main area in Mu is for you to write your code.

+ Enter this code into Mu to say "Hello World".

```python
print("hello world")
```

![code hello world](images/mu_code_step1.PNG)

+ Click `Save` to save your program.

+ Enter the file name `hello` and click `Save`.

![save file](images/mu_code_step2.PNG)

+ Click `Run` to run your program.

![run](images/mu_code_step3.PNG)

Your program will run and the message `hello world` will be displayed.

+ Stop your program by clicking `Stop`.

### Saving your code

Once your code has been saved and given a filename Mu will automatically save it for you.

Mu saves your code every few seconds and everytime you run it, so hopefully you will never loose any work and it also saves it each time your program is run.

You can, of course, also use the Save button any time you want.
